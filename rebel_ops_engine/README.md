# Rebel Operations Engine

A local agentic application for the Rebel Alliance to process, classify, route, and respond to operational requests from across the galaxy. Built as an MVP with Flask — replaceable mock integrations throughout.

**How AI agents help General Leia run the Rebellion like a modern entrepreneur.**

---

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Backend | **Flask** (Python) | Minimal, well-known, easy to run locally, large ecosystem |
| Data models | Python dataclasses + enums | Type-safe, no ORM needed for MVP, easy to swap for SQLAlchemy later |
| Agents | Simple class-based pipeline | Deterministic, testable, no API keys needed, easy to reorder |
| Frontend | **React + Vite** | Modern, fast dev server, native ESM, simple proxy config |
| Tests | **pytest** | Standard Python testing, easy fixture management |

## Business Use Case

General Leia is a busy executive managing the Rebellion. Requests arrive through Intergalactic WhatsApp and Hologram Email. Instead of manually reviewing everything, the system uses AI agents to: receive and normalize requests, scan for Dark Side security risks, classify requests, route to the right owner/team, log missions, send acknowledgments, create calendar tasks, and generate a daily Hologram Briefing.

**Automation does not replace the entrepreneur. It protects the entrepreneur's time.**

## Star Wars Theme

The demo uses Star Wars-inspired names and scenarios but no copyrighted logos, movie images, or protected visual assets. Text, icons, neutral styling, and fictional operational language are used throughout.

```

- High-risk messages → quarantined by DarkSideSecurityAgent, security team notified (no Task created)
- Medium-risk → held at RoutingAgent as `SECURITY_REVIEW` (classified, notified, no Task)
- Yoda strategy → encrypted by YodaEncryptionAgent, `EncryptedTransmission` record created
- Every routed request → `Task` record created
- Leia's private calendar → stored but never exposed via public API

---

## Setup

### Backend

```bash
cd rebel_ops_engine
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

The server starts at `http://localhost:5000`.

If the server fails to start, kill any stale process still bound to port 5000:
```bash
netstat -ano | findstr :5000
taskkill /f /pid <PID>
```

The server auto-detects if port 5000 is already in use and exits with a clear error message.

### Frontend

```bash
cd rebel_ops_engine/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Opens at `http://localhost:3000` and proxies API requests to the backend.

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in values when integrating real APIs:

```bash
cp .env.example .env        # Linux/macOS
copy .env.example .env      # Windows
```

No environment variables are needed for the demo — all integrations are mocked.

## Integration Modules

External API integrations live in `integrations/` and auto-detect credentials. Pipeline agents in `agents/` handle business logic. All modules follow the same pattern: if credentials are present, they make real API calls; if not, they fall back to a mock with logging.

| Integration | File | Real API | Mock fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| Message store | `database.py` | SQLite via built-in `sqlite3` | In-memory SQLite (`:memory:`) |
| Calendar (booking) | `agents/calendar.py` | Google Calendar API / CalDAV | SQLite via database.py |
| Classifier | `agents/classifier.py` | NLP classifier (spaCy, BERT, OpenAI) | Keyword matching |
| Security scanner | `agents/security_agent.py` | Threat intel API / ML model | Keyword scoring |
| Encryption | `agents/encryption.py` | AES-256 / GPG / libsodium | Reverse-string cipher |
| WhatsApp | `integrations/whatsapp_client.py` | Meta WhatsApp Cloud API | Logged mock |
| Email | `integrations/gmail_client.py` | Gmail API (OAuth 2.0) | Logged mock |
| Calendar (sync) | `integrations/calendar_client.py` | Google Calendar API (OAuth 2.0) | Logged mock |
| Notifications | `integrations/clickup_client.py` | ClickUp API | Logged mock |
| Task sync | `integrations/clickup_client.py` | ClickUp API | Logged mock |
| Report delivery | `clients.py` → `ReportDeliveryClient` | Email | Logged mock |

### Pattern for extending an integration

Each module in `integrations/` follows the same pattern. Here's the WhatsApp module as an example — it already calls the real Meta API when credentials are set:

```python
# integrations/whatsapp_client.py
def send_message(to: str, body: str) -> dict:
    phone_number_id = get("WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID")
    access_token = get("WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN")
    if not phone_number_id or not access_token:
        logger.info("[WHATSAPP MOCK] To: %s | Body: %s", to, body[:80])
        return {"status": "mocked", "channel": "whatsapp", "to": to}
    # Real Meta WhatsApp Cloud API call
    url = f"https://graph.facebook.com/v22.0/{phone_number_id}/messages"
    resp = requests.post(url, headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}"}, json={...})
    return resp.json()
```

To add a new integration, create a new module in `integrations/`, add the env vars to `.env.example`, and wire it into the pipeline agent.

The `.env.example` file contains all the environment variables needed for real integrations.

## Security Notes

1. High-risk requests (Palpatine, Vader, Sith, infiltration) are **quarantined** — never routed to any owner.
2. Sender names "Emperor Palpatine" and "Darth Vader" guarantee risk ≥ 50 regardless of message content.
3. Requests asking for Leia's private schedule are blocked unless they are legitimate `calendar_booking` requests with low security risk.
4. The system **never reveals private calendar details** via the public API.
5. Yoda strategy requests use **encrypted transmission** (reverse-string cipher in demo mode, swappable for real encryption).
6. Medium-risk messages are held in `SECURITY_REVIEW` status — classified and notified but no task is created until review.
7. Grogu sensitive cases: sets `requires_leia=True`, `security_risk="high"`, restricts message details with `[RESTRICTED]` error text.
8. Din Djarin protection cases are marked restricted.
9. Every request is logged.
10. Every routed request creates a `Task` record.
11. The daily briefing includes all owners and categories.
